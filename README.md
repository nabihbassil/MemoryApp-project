# MemoryApp-project
In this project we create a Physical map of boxes where each box is shaped like a country (Germany and its surrounding countries).
Once a request from the website is submitted noting that the user has visited a country, motors mounted behind the boxes in the prototype are triggered and push out the box and provide adequate lighting.
Technologies used are: XAMPP DB, Node.js, Fetch, Vanilla.js, Bootstrap.
Physical parts: ESP32 microcontroller, HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Distance Sensor, Servo motors, LED light strip.
